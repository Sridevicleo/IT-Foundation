Ans. PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Q28. What is PaaS?
Ans. PaaS, platform as a service is a cloud service where  someone else is providing you with a platform that we can use to build your own applications. So you would need your own development team, but someone else is providing you with all of the building blocks that you would need to put together every piece of that application

Q29. What does the PaaS provider do?
Ans. They provide the building blocks that are required to build or customise an application with minimal development. There wont be lot of programming involved in this type of service.

Ans. Salesforce.

Q31. If you were planning to deploy the applications in your own data center on your own hardware using applications that you yourself have written, then you’re probably using an ____________where everything in that model is managed by the client.
