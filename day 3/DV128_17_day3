What is DNS and how does it work?
DNS,  Domain name System is a service that is used to convert a fully qualified domain name received from the browser to an IP address to be used by the network.
There are multiple DNS servers across the internet that works on a hierarchy across all of the different fully qualified domain names. Because there are several dns servers across the internet, this is also has a distributed database.


There are 13 root server clusters. In actuality, this consists of over 1,000 different servers.
 There are hundreds of generic top-level domains. These are the domains that are the .com, the .org, the .net, and others.
And then there are also country-level top-level domains, like .us, .ca for Canada, or .uk for the United Kingdom.










What is the structure of the DNS hierarchy?
 The Domain Name System (DNS) hierarchy structure is a hierarchical naming system used to organize and manage domain names on the internet. The DNS hierarchy is organized into multiple levels, each contributing to the resolution of domain names.
The DNS hierarchy structure comprises the following -
1. Root Zone: At the top of the DNS hierarchy is the root zone represented by a single dot (.). It is the starting point for all DNS queries and contains the authoritative name servers that maintain the DNS root zone. There are 13 sets of root servers distributed worldwide.


2. Top-Level Domains (TLDs): Below the root zone are the Top-Level Domains (TLDs), which represent the highest level of the DNS hierarchy. TLDs are further classified into two types: generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and country code top-level domains (ccTLDs). Examples of gTLDs include .com, .org, and .net, while examples of ccTLDs include .us, .uk, and .ca.


3. Second-Level Domains (SLDs): Below the TLDs are the Second-Level Domains (SLDs), which are registered by individuals, organizations, or entities. SLDs are the main part of a domain name and can be further subcategorized for organizational purposes (e.g., example.com, example.org).
4. Subdomains: Subdomains are extensions of a domain name that further categorize or specify a particular area or department within an organization. For example, sub.example.com or mail.example.com.


5. Hostnames: Hostnames are the names assigned to specific devices or resources within a domain or subdomain. They can be assigned to servers, computers, routers, or any other network device. For example, www.example.com or ftp.example.com.


6. Authoritative Name Servers: Authoritative name servers are responsible for storing and providing DNS records for a specific domain or subdomain. These servers maintain information about the IP addresses associated with domain names and respond to DNS queries to resolve domain names into IP addresses.
The DNS hierarchy structure allows for efficient and decentralized management of domain names by distributing authority across various levels. The hierarchical nature of DNS ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient resolution of domain names throughout the internet.




How can you see the translation of a domain name to an IP address?
The translation of the domain name to IP address can be seen by the commands “dig” and “nslookup” whichever is supported by the OS.
The results of “dig” command shows the summary of what was requested, and under the answer section, it shows the ip address of the requested website.


How many root server clusters are there in DNS?
There are 13 root clusters.


What are generic top-level domains?
Generic top-level domains are the domains that are determined as .com, .net .org etc.


What is SPF
SPF or a Sender Policy Framework is a text record found on the DNS server.
 This is a list of all of the email servers that are authorized to send messages using your fully qualified domain name. This record prevents others from spoofing your fully qualified domain name for  sending emails. A mail server receiving an email will query the  DNS server of the domain from which it was sent,  retrieve this SPF record in the DNS server,  to determine if it actually came from an authorized host.




How many servers are in a root server cluster?
	There are over 1000 servers in the root server cluster.


What is the purpose of having three different IP addresses associated with a web server?


The purpose of having multiple different IP addresses associated with a web server is redundancy. If one of those IP addresses is no longer available, the device can use any of these other IP addresses to communicate back to the website.


How can you check the IP addresses associated with a website if the dig command is not available?
by using nslookup command. eg. nslookup www.google.com


What are resource records in DNS?
 Resource records are the  large database of DNS server that contains fully qualified domain names, IP addresses, and other details that help the systems perform the translation between fully qualified domain name and IP address.


Why is a DNS server considered a critical resource?
The DNS server is considered acritical resource because if not for the DNS server, the browser requests for domain will not be translated to IP addresses and hence will not show any results.


How is a DNS server's configuration typically stored?
DNS server configurations are stored in the configurations files on the dns server itself in text format. This makes it relatively easy if you need to make changes to a DNS server’s configuration because you can use any text editor to modify or update this configuration file.




What is an A record and a AAAA record in DNS?
A and AAAA records are the address records on the DNS server.  The A records are address records for IP version 4, and the AAAA record is the address records for IPv6. These records will have a fully qualified domain name and the associated IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.


Is it possible to configure DNS using a web-based front end?
Yes.
How is the time to live in DNS server specified?
The time to live for IP address in the DNS server is specified in DNS configurations. This can be from few minutes to some days. This means that the device will make the request to a DNS server and store or cache that information the specified time after which the information is removed from the cache, and if this device needs to communicate back to the www server, it will need to request, again, the IP address for that particular record.
What does it mean if a device requests the IP address for a particular record?
If the device requests the IP address to DNS server for a particular record, it means that the device will store and cache that information for a period of time specified in the DNS server configurations, after which it will be removed from cache.


How is the same information presented in a web-based front end compared to a text file?
The DNS configurations on the web based front end is more sorted and presented separated under  A record, the hostname, the IP address, and the time to live for this IP address.
What is the purpose of the time to live in a DNS server?
 The time to live in a DNS server is specifying how long an end station will remember this match between fully qualified domain name and IP address.
How long is the time to live for a DNS server typically set for?
usually 5 - 10 mins.
What happens when the time to live for a DNS server is up?
when the ttl for DNS server is up, it means that the cached information of the IP address will be removed from the device.
What is an MX (Mail Exhange) record in DNS?
MX (Mail Exchanger) record is a type of DNS (Domain Name System) record that specifies the mail server responsible for handling email delivery for a particular domain. It is an essential component of email communication and helps direct incoming email messages to the appropriate mail server.
What other record is needed in order for an MX record to work?
A record or the address record to obtain the IP address for the requested domain name.
What is the purpose of a TXT (Text) record in DNS?
TXT records is used to store text information. This is usually public information that can be used for many purpose and can be queried on the server.
How can the authenticity of an email be verified using a DNS text record?


How can you view the text records for a specific domain?
Using ‘dig’ or ‘nslookup”
What are some examples of uses for text records in a DNS server?
	Text (TXT) records on a DNS (Domain Name System) server serve various purposes and are used to store arbitrary text information associated with a domain name. Some of the uses are
1. SPF (Sender Policy Framework), to prevent email spoofing,
2.  DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): DKIM is another email authentication method that adds a digital signature to outgoing emails, allowing the recipient's email server to verify the message's authenticity. A TXT record is used to store the public key used in DKIM signing.
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance): DMARC is a policy framework that enhances email authentication by aligning SPF and DKIM policies. A TXT record is used to publish DMARC policies, instructing email servers how to handle messages that fail authentication.
How can you view text records for a domain if dig is not available?
by using nslookup
What is an SPF record in DNS?
SPF (Sender Policy Framework): SPF is an email authentication method that helps prevent email spoofing. A TXT record can be used to publish SPF information, specifying which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of the domain.
How does an SPF record help to prevent others from spoofing a domain?
This is a list of all of the email servers that are authorized to send messages using your fully qualified domain name. This record prevents others from spoofing your fully qualified domain name for  sending emails. A mail server receiving an email will query the  DNS server of the domain from which it was sent,  retrieve this SPF record in the DNS server,  to determine if it actually came from an authorized host.


What is a DKIM record in DNS?


How is the public key for a DKIM record stored in DNS?
 DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): DKIM is another email authentication method that adds a digital signature to outgoing emails, allowing the recipient's email server to verify the message's authenticity. A TXT record is used to store the public key used in DKIM signing.


How do you configure a DKIM record in a web-based front end?
DKIM record is configured on a web-based front end which is a large bit of text    that is the public key for all of the digital signatures that have been sent from my domain.




What is DMARC in DNS?
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance): DMARC is a policy framework that enhances email authentication by aligning SPF and DKIM policies. A TXT record is used to publish DMARC policies, instructing email servers how to handle messages that fail authentication.


What can you specify in a DMARC record in DNS?
ADMARC record can be created on your DNS server that says, if a message is not validated, simply accept it, or maybe send it to a spam folder, or simply reject the email entirely.

How does DMARC work with SPF and DKIM?
