44_SAS_On Cooling
Self-Assessment Sheet

Q1. What is one of the biggest challenges when it comes to maintaining the operation of a computer?
Ans: Making sure that the computer remains cool at all times.

Q2. How can we provide cooling for our computers?
Ans: Through cool air circulating through the system. The  cool air is pulled  through the front of the system,  pass by the hot components where the air gets warmer which will eventually,  be pushed out the back of the system.


Q3. What factors should be taken into account when thinking about cooling a system? Ans: The vents for inflow and outflow of the air, and the layout of the system should be considered.

Q4. What type of adapter cards have a fan directly connected to them?
Ans: The video cards.

Q5. What is a fan controller?
Ans: The fan controller is a system used to control the speed of the fan and the airflow circulating in the system.

Q6. Is it possible to replace a loud fan with a quieter one?
Ans: Yes.

Q7. Are there any computer systems that have no fans at all?
Ans: Yes.

Q8. What kind of tests is a passively cooled system put through?
Ans: Passively cooled systems are put through number of tests to  make sure that, no matter how hard you use this system, it will be able to keep up with the cooling necessary to keep that system running.

Q9. What is used for passive cooling?
Ans: Heat Sink is used for passive cooling.


Q10. What is a heat sink?
Ans: A heat sink is a specially designed piece of metal. This is usually copper or aluminum alloy, and it usually has a very specific shape that allows it to take heat from a particular component and dissipate that heat as air is passing by the heat sink.

Q11. Thermal paste referred to as ___________________or____________.
Ans. “thermal grease” or “conductive grease,

Q12. What is thermal paste?
Ans: Thermal paste is a material that is put in between the heat sink and the warm component, to make an efficient thermal connection between the component and the heat sink.


Q23. How is the liquid cooled?
Ans: In the high-end  systems where the liquid , usually water is used for cooling, the liquid is cooled by use of fans that blow the air through the radiator to cool the liquid inside of it.

Q24. What is connected to the liquid-cooled system?
Ans:  Radiator.

Q25. What happens to the hot water from the CPU?
Ans: The hot water is sent  thorough the radiator , where it is cooled for circulation again.

Q26. What happens as the hot water goes through the radiator?
Ans: It is cooled down by the fans blowing air through the radiator.

Q27. What happens to the cool water after it is cooled down?
Ans: After the water is cooled down in the radiator, it is again circulated thru CPU again to run the cooling cycle.
