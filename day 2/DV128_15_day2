15_SAS On IPv4 and IPv6
Self-Assessment Sheet
1. How many bits are in an IPv4 address?
32 bits (4 bytes)
2. How many bits are in an IPv6 address?
128 bits (16 bytes)
3. What are the first 64 bits in an IPv6 address?
the first 64 bits of ipv6 address is the network address.

4. What are the second 64 bits in an IPv6 address?
The last 64 bits of ipv6 address is the host address.

5. What is the highest possible digit/number for each byte in an IPv4 address?
255
6. What settings to check when troubleshooting IPv4?
Unique IP address for the device (format 192.168.1.165)
a subnet mask, usually a format  255.255.255.0.
The default gateway (the router ip address) incase the device is communicating outside of the local  subnet (format- 192.168.1.1)
the DNS server settings configuration
DHCP server


7. What is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)?
DHCP is a protocol used to assign the dynamic ip addresses to the devices on the network.
8. What port does a device use to broadcast to DHCP server?
UDP port 67
9. What port does DHCP server use to broadcast to a device?
UDP port 68
10. What is a subnet mask?
Subnet masks determine the network ID and host ID of an IP network upon subnetting. In ipv4 network, the subnet mask is a  32-bit value used in conjunction with an IP address to divide a network into subnetworks or subnets.
They help organize and identify networks, determine IP address ranges for hosts within each subnet, and facilitate efficient routing within a network infrastructure.
11. What is default gateway?
The default gateway is th IPaddress of the router that allows the user to communicate with systems outside of the local subnet.

The default gateway, also known as the default router, is a network device or IP address that serves as the forwarding destination for network traffic from devices within a local network that needs to reach destinations outside of the network. It acts as an intermediary or gateway between the local network and external networks, such as the internet.
