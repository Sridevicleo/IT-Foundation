Q1. What is one of the most common methods of connecting peripherals to computers? Ans: By using USB (Universal Serial Bus)cables.

Q2. One of the early versions of USB was________, and it had ______different speeds.
Ans. One of the early versions of USB was USB1.1, and it had  2 different speeds.

Q3. The early versions of USB had a low speed, which was _________megabits per second and a maximum cable length of around ________ meters.
Ans. The early versions of USB had a low speed, which was 1.5 megabits per second and a maximum cable length of around 3  meters.


Q4. What is the maximum speed of USB 2.0?
Ans: 480 mbps over a maximum cable length of 5 metres.

Q5. What is USB 3.0?
Ans: USB 3.0, just referred as Superspeed USB is an upgrade to USB2.0, supporting 5 gigbits / second over a 3 metre cable.

Q6. What are some common connectors from the USB 1.1 and 2.0 versions?
Ans: Some common connectors from the USB 1.1 and 2.0 versions are the Standard-A plug, standard-B plug, mini-B plug and the micro-B plug.

Q7. The USB 3.0 micro-B plug is very different from the USB 2.0 version.(T/F)
Ans. True.

Q8. What is the USB-C connector?
Ans: A USB-C connector is another upgraded version of USB connectors that are relatively smaller in size and is symmetric both ways so that it can be connected in any orientation (ie, no top/ bottom differentiation)

Q9. What is the maximum speed of USB 3.0?
Ans: 5 gigbits/s over a 3 metre cable.

Q10. How does USB 3.2 improve bandwidth?
Ans: USB 3.2 standard uses an extra lane of communication inside of the  USB-C cable to provide  enhanced bandwidth.


Q11. What is the size of the USB-C connector?
Ans:  The USB-C plug is slightly larger than the micro-B



Q12. What is the name of the USB 3.0 connection type?
Ans: Super speed USB

Q13. What is an update of USB 3.0?
Ans. USB 3.1 Gen 2, or superspeed plus USB

Q14. What is the latest version of USB released in 2017?
Ans: USB3.2

Q15.The standard that used to be USB 3.0, which we change to _______Gen 1 is now called ______Gen 1 or superspeed USB __gigabits per second.
Ans. The standard that used to be USB 3.0, which we change to USB3.1 Gen 1 is now called USB 3.2 Gen 1 or superspeed USB __gigabits per second.


Q16. What is the maximum throughput of USB 3.2 Gen 2 times 2?
 Ans: The USB 3.2 Gen 2 supports speeds of  10 gigabit per second throughput.
 USB3.2 Gen2 times 2, ie when doubled the throughput  with the additional lane, it will support the speed of  maximum 20 gigabits per second.


Q17. What is Thunderbolt?
Ans: Thunderbolt  is a high speed serial connection that is able to put data and power on the same cable.

Q18. Thunderbolt version 1 is a________channel technology and you can put________ _gigabits per second over each of those channels for a maximum throughput of __________gigabits per second.
Ans.  Thunderbolt version 1 is a two channel technology and you can put 10 gigabits per second over each of those channels for a maximum throughput of 20 gigabits per second.


Q19. What is the total aggregated throughput for a Thunderbolt version 3 connection? Ans: 40 gigbits/second.

Q20. Thunderbolt signals can be set over both ______or _________ connections.
Ans. Thunderbolt signals can be set over both copper or fiber connections.

Q21. What is the maximum length of a Thunderbolt connection?
Ans:   The maximum cable length of a thunderbolt connection for a copper cable is 3 meters, and 60 metres for  optical or fiber connection.

Q22. How many Thunderbolt devices can be daisy-chained together?
Ans: 6 devices.

Q23. Before we had a universal serial bus, we were using _____ pin and ____ pin serial connections on our computers to be able to connect peripherals.
Ans. Before we had a universal serial bus, we were using nine pin and 25 pin serial connections on our computers to be able to connect peripherals

Q24. What type of connectors were used before the invention of the Universal Serial Bus?
Ans: DB-9 and DB-25 connectors.
